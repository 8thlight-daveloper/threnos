# Go mutation adapter

The Go implementation of the mutation recipes in [task recipes](../../../process/task-recipes.md). It runs [gomu](https://github.com/sivchari/gomu) through a small wrapper, `gomurun`, and summarizes the result for CI.

It was generalized from onboard-kit's `tools/mutation/`. The wrapper's folders are now flags, and the scripts read the component and contract folders from the environment. The unit tests pass on Go 1.26. The scripts were run against made-up logs and a throwaway Git repository. The generalized wrapper ran gomu v0.3.0 on Go 1.26.8 against one component of a real project, with and without `--cached` and with an accepted survivor. The cached and uncached runs gave the same score, and the second cached run reused every result. A components folder two levels deep (`--components internal/parts`) gave the same score. `--short` has not run against gomu.

Build gomu with the same Go version that runs the tests. A gomu built with Go 1.26 panics with `export data version 5 is greater than maximum supported version 2` when the shell's `go` is newer.

## Use it

1. Copy this folder to `tools/mutation/` in the project.
2. Add `import "tools/mutation/mutation.just"` to the project's justfile.
3. Set the variables at the top of `mutation.just` to the project's components folder, contracts folder, accepted folder, and gomu version. The defaults are `internal`, `contracts`, `tools/mutation/accepted`, and `v0.3.0`.
4. Put `go`, `jq`, `just`, and `git` in the dev shell. `gomurun` runs gomu under `nice`.
5. Edit `SHARED_PATHS` in `plan.sh`, or set it in the environment, to the paths whose change should mutate every component. The default covers the domain model, the Go module files, the mutation tooling, the justfile, the dev shell, and the mutation workflow.

## Files

| File | Recipe | Does |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `mutation.just` | all four | Defines the recipes and their folder variables |
| `gomurun/` | `mutate` | Runs gomu on one component against its contract package, then prints survivors and the score |
| `plan.sh` | `mutate-plan` | Prints the components that changed since a revision as a JSON array |
| `summarize.sh` | `mutate-summary` | Reads a run's log, prints Markdown, and writes `result.json` |
| `report.sh` | `mutate-report` | Combines every `result.json` into one Markdown report with a time chart |
| `bar.sh` | none | Draws the time bar that the summary and the report use |
| `seedfloors.sh` | none | Writes a score floor for each component from a set of results |

## What `gomurun` does

It mutates `<components>/<component>` over an overlay, so no source file changes. It runs the contract package's tests against each mutant, with `-count=1` and `-failfast`, one mutant at a time unless you pass `--workers`. Survivors that a person accepted in `<accepted>/<component>.txt` are counted as accepted and left off the list.

| Flag | Does |
| -- | -- |
| `--workers <n>` | Tests this many mutants at once |
| `--timeout <s>` | Seconds one mutant's tests may take |
| `--short` | Runs the tests with `-short`. A mutant that only a skipped test kills shows as a survivor |
| `--cached` | Reuses the results when the component's source files, contract suite, and gomu version are all unchanged. A change to any one source file mutates the whole component again, because a file's mutants are judged by tests that run the rest of the component. A change outside the component and its contract folder, such as the shared model, does not invalidate the cache |
| `--components`, `--contracts`, `--accepted` | The folders, set by the recipe variables |
| `--gomu-version` | Part of the cache key, set by the recipe variable |

## The log format

`mutate-summary` reads the last line of the `mutate` log:

```text
The mutation score is 0.975000 (39 passed, 1 failed, 2 accepted, 3 not viable, 0 timed out, 0 errors, total is 45)
```

A different mutation tool must print that line, or the project replaces `summarize.sh`. A log without it gives a `result.json` with `null` counts.

## Exit codes and floors

`gomurun` exits 0 when the run finishes, even with survivors. It exits 1 when gomu fails, and when every mutant is not viable, timed out, or errored with none killed, surviving, or accepted. That usually means the component or its contract package does not build, or `--timeout` is too short. It exits 2 on a usage mistake.

Floors are optional. `seedfloors.sh <results-dir> <margin>` writes `floor/<component>.txt` beside the scripts, set a margin below each score. `report.sh` shows each score against its floor and marks a component `BELOW`. A floor does not fail a build by default. `report.sh` lists each component below its floor on stderr and exits 0. Set `FAIL_BELOW_FLOOR=1` in the environment and it exits 1 instead.

## How the score is counted

The score is passed divided by passed plus failed. Not viable mutants, timed-out mutants, and errors stay out of it, and the log line reports each count so a reader can see them. A timed-out mutant is not counted as killed, so a slow test suite does not raise the score. An accepted survivor also leaves the score, so accepting survivors raises it. Seed floors after the accepted lists are settled.

`seedfloors.sh` rounds each floor down to four decimals, so a floor never sits above the score it came from.

## What stays the project's

The gomu version, the worker count the workflow passes, `THRESHOLD_MINUTES`, the floors, and the accepted lists. The wrapper limits Go to two parallel jobs through `GOFLAGS=-p=2` unless the environment already sets `-p`.
